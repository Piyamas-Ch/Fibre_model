# Transmission properties of untapered and tapered optical fibres: simulations and measurements
This Github present additional results in the manuscript Transmission properties of tapered optical fibres: simulations and experimental measure.ments
Experimental results of transmission agiants with effective numerical aperture of untapered fibres are presented in the folder Untapered fibre results.
The untapered fibre presented 

Step-index and Graded-index Tapered fibre simulations by COMSOL and Zemax

Each folder contains the parameter file to be loaded by COMSOL/Zemax, together with a describtion of the parameters. A 
screenshot from the running programs is included.

*The fibre test setup simulation is in the Zemax folder.
