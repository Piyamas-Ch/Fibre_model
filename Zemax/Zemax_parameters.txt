Zemax Tapered Fibre Simulation

The simulation requires the non-sequential mode of Zemax. It uses the Beam ray tracing analysis to find the transmission of the tapered fibre structure.  

The wavelength can be defined in System Explorer: wavelength = 0.635, weigth = 1.0


The Parameters for the simulation can be defined in Non-sequential component Editor as follows:

	1. Effective Numerical aperture can be defined by the Source parameters.
		Source Two Angle:
 	#Analysis Rays: number of ray analysis 
 	Power(Watt): Source power in Watt
 	X-Half Width: radius of input beam in x axis
 	Y-Half Width: radius of input beam in y axis
		*X-Half Width and Y-Half Width need be defined the same value for symmetry beam input.

	2. Cladding parameters:
		Object type: Cylinder volume
	Front R: radius of an input fibre cladding surface
	Z length: length of cladding
	Back R: radius of an output fibre cladding surface

   - 5:1 taper, Front R= 0.625, Back R= 0.125, Z length = 1000
   - 4:1 taper, Front R= 0.625, Back R= 0.15625, Z length = 1000

	3. Core parameters:
 	Object type: Cylinder volume
 	Front R: radius of an input fibre core surface
 	Z length: length of cladding
 	Back R: radius of an output fibre core surface

   - 5:1 taper, Front R= 0.625, Back R= 0.125, Z length = 1000
   - 4:1 taper, Front R= 0.25, Back R= 0.05, Z length = 1000
 

To define specific refractive index (n), the Gradient 1 surface is applied to the core and cladding surface.
The Gradient profile can be defined by selecting on 'Object properties' then select 'Index'. Choose 'GRIN' 
	
	Gradient 1 refractive profile: n (r) = N0 + Nr2*r^2* Nr1* r

The step index profile is with Nr2=0 in both core and cladding.
	step-index fibre core profile parameters 
		Nr2 = 0
		N0 = 1

	step-index fibre cladding profile parameter
		Nr2 = 0
		N0 = 1

The graded-index is with Nr2 = -0.219 in core and 0 in cladding.
	graded-index fibre core parameters 
		Nr2 = -0.219
		N0 = 1.4708
