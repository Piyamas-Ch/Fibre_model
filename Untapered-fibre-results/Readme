We characterised variety of untapered fibres as the reference to test the tapered fibre with the same setup and method explained in manuscript. Table A.1 shows the specifications of untapered fibre: type, core size, manufactured numerical aperture and part number.
Figure attached in this folder `untaper_TvsNA' presented the transmission and effective numerical aperture results of variety of untapered fibres. Table A.2 presents the maximum transmission value of measured fibre along the NA at maximum transmission and NA at 80% of transmission.
Note that core size shown in Table A.1 and TableA.2 is mode field diameter size for single mode fibre. The multimode fibre core presented in the table is geometric size.



Our measurements indicate that the endlessly single mode fibre (ESM) and single mode fibre (SM) have lower transmissions compared to double-clad fibre and multimode step-index (SI) and graded-index (GI) fibre.
These measurements will be accurate for comparing fibres with similar geometry but higher transmissions at very small NA may be obtained with individually optimized configurations, particularly with single mode fibres.  The custom GI fibre has slightly less transmission than the Thorlabs products comparing the same core size and type. We found there is no significant difference between NAmax and manufactured for SM, ESM and double-clad fibres. However, the NAeff of multimode fibres in our setup is smaller than the manufacturer specifications.
